<a class="anchor" id="Images-and-Imageviews"></a><p>GNUstep provides mechanisms for the retreival and display of images. A number of objects beginning with <code class="code">NSImage</code><a class="footnote" id="DOCF17" href="#FOOT17"><sup>17</sup></a> exist, each with slightly different functions.
</p>
<p>An <em class="dfn">image</em> is represented using an instance of the <code class="code">NSImage</code> class. You can create these using the path or URL of a file, raw image data or a pasteboard.
</p>
<p>Images may contain zero or more image representations, or <em class="dfn">imagereps</em>. For example, a photographic image may contain both black and white and colour representations, or representations at different resolutions. The purpose of this is to allow GNUstep to select the best representation for a particular device. GNUstep may select a lower-resolution representation for a screen, while selecting the highest resolution representation for printed output. If there was also a vector representation, it may choose to use it for printed output. An imagerep is represented by an instance of a <code class="code">NSImageRep</code> subclass.
</p>
<p>An image by itself is not enough for rendering. Images are rendered on a window using an <code class="code">NSImageView</code> object. These let you set the alignment and scaling for displaying the image. They also let you set a graphical border using the <code class="code">-setFrameStyle:</code> method. <code class="code">NSImageView</code> is a control, so the normal control/cell model applies to it.
</p>
<p>If you only need to display an image on it&rsquo;s own, use <code class="code">NSImageView</code>. For more complicated image rendering, e.g. inside of custom views, use <code class="code">NSImage</code> to draw or composite at a certain point.

<h3 class="section"><span>14.1 Using NSImage<a class="copiable-link" href="#Using-NSImage"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Whether using <code class="code">NSImageView</code> or not, you will have to create an <code class="code">NSImage</code> object. It provides a number of constructors for loading an image with a path, a URL or a data object (<code class="code">NSData</code>). Note that for loading from a file or URL, two sets of methods are provided. These have subtly different meanings, as shown below:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><code class="code">-initWithContentsOfFile:</code></dt>
<dt><code class="code">-initWithContentsOfURL:</code></dt>
<dd><p>These methods load the image from the specified location, and create image representations for rendering later.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">-initByReferencingFile:</code></dt>
<dt><code class="code">-initByReferencingURL:</code></dt>
<dd><p>These methods don&rsquo;t actually load the image straight away. Instead, when you try to composite or draw the image at a location, it loads the image from disk and generates a representation at that time.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>From here, an image can be drawn within a view using any of the drawing/compositing/dissolving methods. You can also get at the imagereps using the <code class="code">-representations</code> method (amongst others).
</p>

<div class="section-level-extent" id="Drawing-Images">
<h3 class="section"><span>14.2 Drawing Images<a class="copiable-link" href="#Drawing-Images"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p><code class="code">NSImage</code> provides a number of methods for drawing an image. It also provides quite a number means to control how an image is composited at its destination.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF18" href="#FOOT18"><sup>18</sup></a> <em class="dfn">Compositing</em> refers to the way the image is rendered onto the destination surface.
</p>
<p>Simply drawing an image into your view may be achieved with the <code class="code">-drawRepresentation:inRect:</code> method. In other cases, you may wish to draw it onto a destination surface with a compositing operation, in which case you can use the <code class="code">-drawAtPoint:fromRect:operation:fraction:</code> or <code class="code">-drawInRect:fromRect:operation:fraction:</code> methods.
</p>
<p>These take a rectangle from the source image, and composite it onto a destination surface. The compositing operation specifies how the image is blended with the destination surface, and is a constant in <code class="code">NSCompositingOperation</code>. These constants define what the destination image looks like after a composite, as a result of combining the source and destination image. <a class="footnote" id="DOCF19" href="#FOOT19"><sup>19</sup></a>
</p><dl class="table">
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeClear</code></dt>
<dd><p>The destination is left transparent.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeCopy</code></dt>
<dd><p>The source image appears at the destination.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeSourceOver</code></dt>
<dd><p>The source image appears wherever it is opaque, and the destination image elsewhere.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeSourceIn</code></dt>
<dd><p>The source image appears wherever both the source and destination are opaque, and is transparent elsewhere.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeSourceOut</code></dt>
<dd><p>The source image appears where the source image is opaque but the destination image is transparent, and is transparent elsewhere.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeSourceAtop</code></dt>
<dd><p>The source image appears wherever both images are opaque, the destination appears wherever the destination is opaque but the source image is transparent, and the result is transparent elsewhere.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeDestinationOver</code></dt>
<dd><p>The destination image appears wherever it is opaque, and the source image elsewhere.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeDestinationIn</code></dt>
<dd><p>The destination image appears where both images are opaque, and the result is transparent elsewhere.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeDestinationOut</code></dt>
<dd><p>The destination image appears wherever it is opaque but the source image is transparent, and it is transparent elsewhere.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeDestinationAtop</code></dt>
<dd><p>The destination image appears wherever both images are opaque, the source image appears wherever the source image is opaque but the destination is transparent, and the result is transparent elsewhere.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositeXOR</code></dt>
<dd><p>The result of and exclusive OR operation between the bits defining the pixels in bothe images.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositePlusDarker</code></dt>
<dd><p>The result of adding the values of the colour components of the pixels in both images, with the result approaching zero as a limit.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCompositePlusLighter</code></dt>
<dd><p>The result of adding the values of the colour components of the pixels in both images, with the result approaching one as a limit.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The <var class="var">fraction</var> parameter corresponds to the coverage of the source alpha channel with zero making the source transparent and one making the source fully opaque.

<h3 class="section"><span>14.3 Working with image representations<a class="copiable-link" href="#Working-with-image-representations"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Quite a number of classes inherit from <code class="code">NSImageRep</code> to provide means to load different types of image formats, such as bitmaps, TIFF images, etc:
</p><dl class="table">
<dt><code class="code">NSBitmapImageRep</code></dt>
<dd><p>For bitmap (raster) images, <code class="code">NSBitmapImageRep</code> is used. PNG, JPG and TIFF image file formats would be represented with the class. 
</p>
<p>You can retreive information about the image with methods such as <code class="code">-bitsPerPixel</code> or <code class="code">-isPlanar</code>. For image formats that can store metadata (such as resolution information or camera settings), the <code class="code">-valueForProperty:</code> and <code class="code">-setProperty:withValue:</code> methods can be used to manipulate it.
</p>
<p>If necessary, it contains initialisers for instantiating it from raw data(<code class="code">-initWithData:</code>) and from the display (<code class="code">-initWithFocusedViewRect:</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCachedImageRep</code></dt>
<dd><p>This image representation is cached bitmap left over from the result of executing some instructions or data. It lives inside an off-screen window.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSCustomImageRep</code></dt>
<dd><p>These are representations which can be drawn in a manner that is defined by the application. You initialize these with a selector that is executed against a delegate object when <code class="code">-draw</code> is called on the representation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">NSEPSImageRep</code></dt>
<dd><p>Unsupported.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <code class="code">NSImageRep</code> class itself also provides a number of methods for gaining information about what kinds of file formats GNUstep supports, and for instantiating images dynamically based on raw image data or the contents of a file or URL.
